	<!--This enables the script to match a config file (settings.json) to the account you are launching. 
	Eg if using account 1, this is achieved by overwriting settings.json with settings1.json.
	Due to this, if enabled, settings1.json,settins2.json etc will not be updated if you update your game settings.
	As such	you will need to manually update your settings.json config file, see readme for more details. -->

	<!--Can be used standalone or in conjunction with the standard setting switcher above.
	This enables the menu option to enter 's' and manually pick between settings config files. Use this if you want to select Awesome or Poo graphics settings for an account.
	Any setting file with a number after it will not be an available option (eg settings1.json will not be an option).
	To make settings option, you can load from, call the file settings.<name>.json eg(settings.Awesome Graphics.json) which will appear as "Awesome Graphics" in the menu.-->
