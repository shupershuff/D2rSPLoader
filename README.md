# Overview
TBC, making a cutdown version of D2rLoader specifically aimed at tracking time spent on offline characters. Useful for tracking total time spent on Grail :)

Work in progress but plan to enable the following features:
- DONE Launch in offline mode for those who want to help their mates fill games online but still play single player (uses parameter '-region xxx')
- DONE Skip Game video (launch game with mod to set intro and games Act videos to 0 bytes).
- DONE Start Grail App (of your choosing) if not already running at game launch.
- DONE Start Run timer app (of your choosing) if not already running at game launch.
- Incorporate [Offline Backup](https://github.com/shupershuff/FolderBackup) and [cloud sync'd backup](https://github.com/shupershuff/D2rSinglePlayerBackup).
- Load/Unload Save game sets (eg if switching between Grail characters and edited test characters)
- Track time by character by assessing save game files for changes
- Show only characters your interested in on main screen (whitelist to exclude mules)
- Menu for launch options for seed, nosave, enablerespec, playersX, resetofflinemaps etc

Will probably work on this over new year break and have something early 2025 :)
