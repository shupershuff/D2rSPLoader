# Overview
TBC, making a cutdown version of D2rLoader specifically aimed at tracking time spent on offline characters. Useful for tracking total time spent on Grail :)

Work in progress but plan to enable the following features:
- Launch in offline mode
- Skip Intro video
- Skip In game act videos
- Track time by character by assessing save game files for changes
- Show only characters your interested in on main screen (whitelist to exclude mules)
- Launch options ffor seed, nosave, enablerespec, playersX, resetofflinemaps etc
